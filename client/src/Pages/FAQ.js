                <h5 className='fw-bold'>Are LED neon signs prone to breakages? What are they made of?</h5>
                <p>Our LED Neon is made from proprietary PVC molding technology, with a high quality acrylic as backing.</p>
                <p>Compared to traditional expensive glass tube neon, our signs produce relatively no heat, are extremely efficient, last much longer, and are also much stronger than traditional neon signs.</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>Can you use LED Neon Signs outdoor?</h5>
                <p>Yes, we can produce waterproof versions for outdoor events and outdoor permanent installation. Please specify your application when you submit your custom order inquiry, or choose the option directly from our product pages.</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>What's the typical lead time for custom orders?</h5>
                <p>All orders are made to order by hand in one of our international production facilities with the upmost of care and attention to detail.</p>

                <p>We also have a rush order service which brings down this time to only 3-8 business days!</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>How do you power the neon signs?</h5>
                <p>All our signs connect directly into a standard power socket (with plug for each shipping country) and it comes with a 12V transformer. Our signs are not battery or USB Powered due to the voltage requirements to deliver the extremely high quality that we provide.</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>How long do the LED neon signs last?</h5>
                <p>The lifetime of our LED neon signs lasts a minimum of 30,000 hours. That is equivalent to about 10 years if you turn on the neon sign for about 10 hours per day. This is about 3x times longer than the lifespan of traditional gas neon signs.</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>Does it require any maintenance?</h5>
                <p>Not at all! Our LED is environmentally friendly and completely maintenance free.</p>

                <h5 className='fw-bold'>What's the length of the power cord?</h5>
                <p>The cord from the neon sign is 1.8 meters (6ft) long encased with a clear coating, with an additional of 1.2 meters (4ft) of black cord from the power adaptor. There's another 1 meter (3ft) black from the adaptor to your plug. In total it's around 4 meters (13ft) from the neon sign to your power plug.</p>
                <h5 className='fw-bold'>How safe are LED neon signs?</h5>
                <p>Our LED neon signs are only 12V so they run at a much safer voltage than traditional neon. Because of its low output voltage, our signs will not heat up even after long hours of operating.</p>

Our neon signs can either be mounted on the wall, or be hung using our special hanging materials which we can provide. We usually provide the wall mounting installation materials with our signs, so please specify if you need the hanging chain materials instead.</p>
